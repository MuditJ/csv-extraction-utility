This is a simple utility tool to extract specific fields data from the CUCM
config data using a user provided JSON schema file. A couple of sample 
JSON schema files are provided to specify the structure that is required.

Steps:

Ideally, create a virtual environment before starting:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

From the base directory, the utility tool can be run from the commandline after import:
from csv_extract import extract_fields

View the documentation for the method using help:
help(extract_fields)


By default, the program looks for the JSON schema file in the base directory where the two sample JSON files are stored. 
Thus, create a new schema file in this location only.
This is also where the directory holding the csvs with the extracted fields 
will be stored under the directory name "extracted-data"
